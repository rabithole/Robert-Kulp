# NOAA App
- The goal of the NOAA app is mainly for personal use for back country skiing. The data points chozen are needed for accurate forecasting. In particular the freezing level is often difficulut to find for a given area. 

## API's used: 
#### NOAA: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2
	- Dug through NOAA's api to choose the relevant data for my goals.
#### OnTheSnow: (Not yet utilized in current build) http://docs.clientservice.onthesnow.com/docs/index.html
#### Student built API for the Guidr project.

# React version: 
	react: 16.13.1

# Guidr
- Guidr is a Lambda School project. 
- Full CRUD is used. 
- The API is student built and has the following limitations. 
	- The API is hosted on Heroku
	- Data is reset periodically. I am unsure of the duration.
	- It cannot upload a blob. 

## Known Guidr Trip Bugs and To Do's...
- Database resets periodically. Unsure of the time frame. 
- Unmounted component error, Can't update state. 
- Make check boxes work or remove the check boxes.
- rabithole.com/#/ Look into #/...
- Make the time stamp human readable. 
- CSS for mobile
- Loader spinner or ? 
- Add NOAA API modal.
