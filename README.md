## Guidr Trip Bugs
	* This is a school project. 
			* The API is student built. 
			* It resets daily. I am not sure of the interval as I did not set it up. 
			* The API is hosted on Heroku

	* Guidr uses Context API
	* Create trip should redirect to trip list
	* New trip page needs to be refreshed to show updated trip
	* Single trip description needs to be refreshed after being updated
	* check for timeout from API. If signed out due to timeout, remove local storage token. 
	* Time until database resets
