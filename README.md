# Guidr
- Guidr is a school project. 
- Full CRUD is used. 
- The API is student built and has the following limitations. 
	- The API is hosted on Heroku
	- Data is reset periodically. I am unsure of the duration.
	- It cannot upload a blob. 

## Guidr Trip Bugs
- Database resets periodically. Unsure of the time frame. 
- Unmounted component error, Can't update state. 
- Make check boxes work or remove the check boxes.
- rabithole.com/#/ Look into #/...
- Make the time stamp human readable.
