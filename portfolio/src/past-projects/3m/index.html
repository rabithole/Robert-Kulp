    <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p><b>Triple M Alpacas</b> is located in Washougal, Washington in the foothills of the Cascades, near the mouth of the Columbia River Gorge.  The name <em><strong>Triple M</strong></em> started back in the 1940's as a dairy farm, 	        owned by Buds grandfather, JC. We wanted to continue with a family name that reaches back generations.
        </p>
    <p>Our herd began with three <b>Huacaya</b> females of Bolivian decent and has grown to a herd of fifteen. Our <em>herdsire</em> was a Huacaya named Gorgeous Palitin, also of Bolivian decent. We specialize in the darker colored animals with the goal of 
        improving the density and fineness of the fleece. Our goal is to help others start their own alpaca farm.</p>
         
         <p>Please contact us if you are interested in <em>Alpaca sales</em> or if you would like to visit our <em>Alpaca farm</em>.</p>

        <h2>A little about Alpacas</h2>
 <p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpaca" target="blank">Alpacas</a> are herd animals native to the Andes Mountains of South America. Gentle and easy to handle they have large curious eyes, and are relatively small, ranging from 120 to 180 pounds. They are related to the camel and llama and all are classified as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelid" target="blank">camelids</a>. Smaller and less capable as a pack animal, they have been specifically bred for their soft fine fiber and meat. 
</p>
<p>
 They produce 5-15 pounds of <em>fleece</em> each year that is virtually free of Lanolin making it <b>hypoallergenic</b>.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpaca_fiber" target="_blank">Alpaca fiber</a> is soft, durable, luxurious, silky, warmer and less itchy than comparable types of wool. It is naturally water repellent and difficult to ignite. Alpaca fleece is used to make simple inexpensive garments as well as fine suits. There are two types of Alpacas, the <b>Huacaya</b>, pronounced "Wuh-kai-ya" and the <b>Suri</b>. The Huacaya have fluffy teddy bear like fleece while the Suri has shiny long locks with slightly curly hairs.  
 </p>
 <p>	Alpaca farming is relatively simple as farms go. They only need an open weather shelter in severe weather. Having three stomachs enables them to optimally digest nutrients from low quality foraging. Hay and grass in your field will provide them most of the nutrients  they need. Most farmers in the states will supplement their diets with low-protein grass hay and a vitamin enriched feed from their local feed store. The benefits of farming alpaca's ranges from tax advantages, selling of fiber or meat, enjoyment or just keeping your fields from becoming over grown. Refer to the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Publication-225,-Farmer's-Tax-Guide" title="Farmers Tax Guide, Publication 225" target="_blank">Farmers Tax Guide</a> for further information. </p>
 <p>A female Alpaca can reproduce for about 15 years. Pregnancy lasts for about 11 1/2 months and typically give birth to one cria or offspring. The lifespan for male and females is 15 to 20 years. </p>
